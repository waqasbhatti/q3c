Q3C is the plugin for PostgreSQL database, designed for working with large astronomical catalogs or any catalogs of objects on the sphere. Q3C allows you to perform fast circular, elliptical or polygonal searches on the sphere as well as perform fast positional cross-matches and nearest neighbor queries.

The ideas behind Q3C are described in this paper  [Koposov et al. (2006)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ASPC..351..735K)
The documentation and installation instructions are available here http://code.google.com/p/q3c/source/browse/README.q3c

Throughout the years Q3C has been used to perform spatial searches in several multi-Tb astronomical datacenters.
